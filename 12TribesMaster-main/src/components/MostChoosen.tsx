We are to be a light to the Gentiles so that they may also obtain salvation and the keeping of the law. We are his servants as a Nation and we are t do his will and walk righteously as he is righteous. We are so Holy and precious that the world was made for the children of Israel sake, so lets walk talk and keep his ways so that we may store up good works in Heaven and show our Faith with works.</p>
